A dummy project to house https://github.com/ShadyElyaski/ios-filter-control
that just includes the *.h and *.m file.

Generated bridge metadata file for RubyMotion.  The bridge metadata was moved
to the root of the project in order for RubyMotion to work correctly.

Command used to generate the bridge metadata:

gen_bridge_metadata -F complete --no-64-bit -c '-I.' *.h -o BridgeSupport.bridgesupport
